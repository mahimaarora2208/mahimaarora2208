<h3 align="center">A Robotics Engineer</h3>
<div align="center">
    
 :mortar_board: Graduated with a Masters in Robotics Engineering from **University of Maryland, College Park** 

 🔭 I am open to Full-Time roles in the US focused on **Robotics Software Development and Autonomy**.
  <br> (I am especially excited about areas like Robot Simulation, Perception, Robot Behaviors, Motion Planning and Human-Robot Interaction but I'm always looking to dive into new challenges and learn along the way!)

 💼 With over 3 years of experience in Robotics Software Development, including work at [@Vecna Robotics](https://www.vecnarobotics.com/) and [@Siemens](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/industries/small-medium-business/robotics/), I enjoy wearing multiple hats to tackle complex real-world challenges. My work spans programming vision algorithms, simulating vehicle behaviors to design meaningful scenarios, developing robotics controllers, and building navigation and localization algorithms, along with implementing deep learning techniques for perception. In my current role as an Autonomous Driving Software Engineer at [@NIST](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-automated-vehicles-program), one of my focus was on system interaction testing. This was achived by developing an ontology based framework for autonomous vehicles which includes creating intricate driving scenarios, capturing relevant metrics, designing ODD, and showcasing the feasibility and value of studying systems interaction. I’ve also had the opportunity to design and curate experiments for real-world data collection on test tracks at VTTI, which has been a valuable hands-on learning experience bridging simulation and real-world validation. During my tenure as a Robotics Software Engineer at [@Children's National Hospital](https://research.childrensnational.org/labs/medical-robotics), I contributed to the development of optimal needle trajectories for an epilepsy procedure and collaborated with the neurosurgeons to compare and validate the results. Moreover, I played a key role in developing novel ways to identify needle penetration through tumors to achieve the goal of maximum penetration.
