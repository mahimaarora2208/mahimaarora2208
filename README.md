### Hello Roboticists ðŸ‘‹ :robot:

## Who am I ?

I am a **Roboticist** by profession and a Roboticist by  :heart:. 
I believe robots have a lot to learn from humans and vice-versa. I aim to be a roboticist who builds "Robots for a Purpose" and wants to see humans and robots 
collaborate in the same environment and not replace each other.
